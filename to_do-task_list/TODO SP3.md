# TODO List for Status Presentation #3

## Tasks for SP3:
1. **Final results summary slide:** these should be the results after you made the improvements discussed above. For every metric, show the average training and test results side by side in a table. Add slides for things like confusion matrix, AUC/ROC, etc.
2. **Improvements slide:** show improvements of your results over your initial model results.
3. **Analytic results slide:** here you talk a little more about the model results: what worked, what didn't, what you could do better.
4. **Evaluation slide:** finally, you need to answer the question. Do not use your analytic results as your answer, you need to derive some real-world actionable advice or answer to the question. When you do this slide, ask yourself the same question that I will ask you during your presentation: Does what you wrote here answer the question?
5. **Next steps:** conclude with some thoughts on how someone might use your work as the basis for advancing the science.
6. **References slide:** list all the references from your slides. Note, this does not have to be all the references you used in your paper.
