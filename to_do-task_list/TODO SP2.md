# TODO List for Status Presentation #2

## Tasks for SP2:
1. Model concept slide: showing black box diagram. Your inputs and output must be stated in terms of measurement units (see slides on this). Your reasons for selecting this set of features should come from feature selection and engineering. Your target should come from the business problem and be reflected in the fishbone diagram. Your model approach will be selected at this time based on the data and business problem and go into the box.
2. Modeling background slide: describe prior literature related to past efforts to model this problem. Best way to show this is with a table that shows the paper reference (title, date, authors), type of model used, and a short comment about how their approach differs from what you plan to do. If the table is too big for one slide, add more slides. 
3. Algorithm selection slide: your selection must be based on the things we talked about in class related to data characteristics and problem type. Describe one or more that you selected, and others that you rejected, and reasons for each. 
4. Hyperparameter slide: describe the hyperparameters you want to adjust for each algorithm you will use and the value ranges. Have some reasoning for your choices.
5. Metrics slide: talk about the metrics you will use for your model. Also discuss what metrics were used in the references on the model background slide. Include a discussion of what value you expect from your metrics (e.g., what % of accuracy) and support this with logic and/or literature.
6. Initial results: you should have run your model at least once now, so talk about your initial results (metrics), hyperparameter values and how you plan to improve the results in terms of the things we discussed: hyperparameter optimization, ensembles, regularization, transfer learning, gradient descent.
