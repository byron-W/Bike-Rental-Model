# TODO List for Status Presentation #1

## Tasks for SP1:
1. Title slide: title of project, date, names of project members
2. Business problem slide: state the business question, provide a little background about why it is important
3. Background slide: describes prior literature supporting the importance of this problem and how it affects people
4. Analytic problem slide: showing fishbone diagram. Every entry on the fishbone must be supported by a literature reference, and I will check to ensure they are legit
5. Data summary slide: name of dataset, citation information for dataset, summary of the following: data file / structure type, # rows, # features, target name (if any).
6. Data features list: do not, under any circumstances, try to squeeze in an image of the full table. Just list the feature names. Recommendation: group them into their data types (e.g., integers, floats, categories, etc.). Be prepared to talk about what each one means, because I will ask during your presentation.
7. Data cleaning slide: here you address the issues with your data and how you dealt with them. The list of potential issues can be found in our class slides.
8. Feature selection and engineering: describe how you selected your final feature set for the model. Also talk about how you created new features, e.g., PCA components, combined features, split features, derived features, etc.
