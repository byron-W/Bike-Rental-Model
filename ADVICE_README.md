# Introduction  
  
- There is a lot to learn in this class  
- There are a lot of decisions your team needs to make about your project  
- There is a lot of what you learn that you need to apply and explain in your project  

***Finally, you can choose to heed or ignore this advice, but your grade will reflect your choice. I will easily be able to see all activity from each team member in here, and can quickly make a decision about what percentage of the full team grade you receive based on your level of effort relative to your peers.***
  
# Tools I gave you  
  
- References on how to use GitHub to collaborate, how to create your LaTeX document, detailed rubric that can be used as a checklist, and a Markdown cheat sheet  
- GitHub for team collaboration on code and the document  
- A final report template  
- A PowerPoint template for your check-ins
- Detailed slides from lectures that you can refer back to   

# Tools you should create  
  
- Meeting notes template  
- Task checklist with space for names and due dates  
- Project schedule for planning the work  
- Markdown documents where people can just post their ideas for the project and the next meeting (I made a folder for these and an example notes page)  
  
# Project completion advice
  
- Read through all the documents here in rubric_and_references  
- Turn the project_rubric.md into a checklist that you can use to ensure project requirements are met  
- Work on the project the whole semester:  
    - The project final report is based on the data mining process CRISP-DM  
    - This semester was built around the process  
    - The order of classes and lectures follows the same order as your final report  
    - So, during the data lectures, take notes that you can apply to your project  
    - If you work to apply what you learn to the project, then you will find the quizzes much easier  
  
# Team coordination advice  
  
- Meet on a weekly basis  
- Every good meeting should:  
    - accomplish action items from the prior meeting  
    - generate new action items to be done before the next meeting  
    - make everyone on the team aware of the status of all things that need to be done  
    - move the team closer to completing the project  
    - produce a record of when and where the meeting was, who attended, and all the stuff above  
    - generate ideas and discussion from every participant (no one should be sitting silently), team members should come to the meeting prepared with at least three ideas they want to offer to the team  
- Tasks should never be assigned to 'all' or else no one will do them:  
    - one person's name should be assigned, to ensure the task gets done  
    - that person may do the task, or may assign someone else to do it  
    - every task must have a due date  
    - there must be a list of tasks, with assigned names and due dates  
    - the responsible person must report out on status of their assigned tasks at the meetings
