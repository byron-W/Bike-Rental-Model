Workflow for Team Collaboration
1. Create a Branch: Each team member creates a branch for their task:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/task-name
```

2. Work on the Branch: Add changes and commit them locally:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Description of changes"
```

3. Push to GitHub:
```bash
git push origin feature/task-name
```

4. Open a Pull Request (PR):
- On GitHub, go to Pull Requests.
- Click New Pull Request and select the branch to merge.
- Add a description and request reviews from teammates.

5. Review and Merge:
- Team members review the PR.
- Once approved, merge the PR into main.
